Velociraptor's curated ruleset is a collection of rules which have been modified to get the most out of Velociraptor's endpoint detection capabilities. While most Sigma rulesets focus on event logs, this ruleset queries dynamic and static artifacts enhancing the Sigma detections. 

This page is provided for easy searching through the curated rules. If you wish to contribute a rule, you can submit a sigma rule for review through the button to the right.
